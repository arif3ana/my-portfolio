              I'm a web developer based in Indonesia. My journey into the world
              of web development started when I was in vocational high school.
              There, I, Arif Triana, focused my attention and hard work on the
              software engineering program. I felt incredibly grateful when I
              graduated with the highest honors in the field.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, my journey has been more than just learning the technical
              aspects. I am actively involved in several school organizations
              that help me develop my social and leadership skills. Through
              these experiences, I began to see that the world of web
              development was an exciting stage full of potential.
            </p>
            <p>
              While still in vocational school, I was given the opportunity by
              the school to intern at DKIS (Communication, Informatics and
              Statistics Office). This experience truly opened my eyes to the
              dynamic and opportunity-rich world of information technology. It
              was here that my primary interest in becoming a web developer
              began to take shape.
            </p>
            <p>
              After graduating from high school, I decided to take it a step
              further by attending bootcamps and obtaining certificates to
              enrich my knowledge. Currently, I have specialized as a full-stack
              developer with skills in both front-end and back-end website
              development.
            </p>
            <p>
              I diligently practice and engage in various projects, one of which
              is the "wearhouse-web" inventory website project. This project,
              which uses ReactJS for the frontend and Laravel for the backend,
              is one of my personal projects dedicated to honing my skills. I
              meticulously designed everything from the user interface to the
              database schema to match the features I wanted to build. You can
              find this project in my GitHub repository at{" "}
              <a

              </a>
            </p>
            <p>
              Every step of this journey has been fueled by my enthusiasm to
              continue learning and growing in this ever-changing field. I
              sincerely hope to make a positive contribution by creating
              innovative and useful web solutions for everyone.
