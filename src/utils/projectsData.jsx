      "MyDiary is a web application project that I built with the main function of storing user's daily notes. this project is my first React project when I learned in dicoding, this project used to be called catatan-pribadi-app and now I rebuild this catatan-pribadi-app project with a little adjustment from what I learned. \n\n In this MyDiary project, users can record activities or events that occur every day and store them in the MyDiary web application. Then, the daily notes can be accessed again in the future. All of this is designed to help users rec.ord every precious moment of their lives and keep it easily accessible in the future. \n\n I think this project may not be perfect, so I would like to invite you to visit this MyDiary project and provide feedback or constructive criticism and suggestions to improve this MyDiary project and the way I work in building future projects. Thank you for your time, I hope you enjoy looking at my MyDiary project.",
