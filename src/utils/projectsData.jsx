      "MyDiary is a web application project that I built with the main function of storing user's daily notes. this project is my first React project when I learned in dicoding, this project used to be called catatan-pribadi-app and now I rebuild this catatan-pribadi-app project with a little adjustment from what I learned. \n\n In this MyDiary project, users can record activities or events that occur every day and store them in the MyDiary web application. Then, the daily notes can be accessed again in the future. All of this is designed to help users rec.ord every precious moment of their lives and keep it easily accessible in the future. \n\n I think this project may not be perfect, so I would like to invite you to visit this MyDiary project and provide feedback or constructive criticism and suggestions to improve this MyDiary project and the way I work in building future projects. Thank you for your time, I hope you enjoy looking at my MyDiary project.",

      "The 'simple-todoList' project is a simple web application designed to help users create and organize daily to-do lists. This web application is designed to increase user productivity in an efficient and easy-to-use way. \n\n I developed this web application using localstorage, a browser feature that allows users to store data on the client side without the need for an external server or database. Thus, the data entered by the user, including the daily to-do list in this project, is stored locally on the user's device or browser. \n\n This project is built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it a simple yet effective way to help users manage their daily tasks. Despite its simplicity, I hope this project will provide significant benefits to users. \n\n I urge you to take a look at this project and provide valuable feedback. Constructive opinions, criticism, and suggestions will be greatly appreciated as they will help me improve this project and my development skills. Thank you for your time and I hope you enjoy viewing my project. \n\n User Guide : \n\n# Adding a new task : \n\n - Click on the line to the left of the 'Submit' button. \n\n - Type the task you want to add. \n\n - Click the Submit button. \n\n # Mark a Task Complete : \n\n - Click the task you want to mark as complete. \n\n # Delete all completed tasks : \n\n - When all tasks have been completed or checked off, the 'All Tasks List is Complete' button will appear, click the button to delete all tasks. \n\n Usage Tips : \n\n # Prioritize tasks : \n\n Use this application to prioritize your daily tasks by entering the most important tasks or those that should be completed first. \n\n # Consistently mark completed : \n\n Marking completed tasks helps you track your progress and feel good about your accomplishments.",
